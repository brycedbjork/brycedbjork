# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post.

Here's some **bold text** and _italic text_ to demonstrate markdown formatting.

## A Subheading

You can write anything you want in these MDX files. They support:

- Lists
- **Bold** and _italic_ text
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Code blocks

```js
console.log("Hello from a code block!");
```

That's it for now!
